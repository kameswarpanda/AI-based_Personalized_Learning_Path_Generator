# AI-based Personalized Learning Path Generator

## Overview

This project is an AI-based application designed to generate personalized learning paths based on user input, including skills, interests, and educational background. The application consists of a front-end interface built with HTML and Bootstrap, and a back-end service developed using Spring Boot that communicates with the OpenAI API to generate recommendations.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting skills, interests, and educational background.
- Integration with OpenAI API to generate personalized learning paths.
- Fast and responsive design using Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 11 or above).
- **Maven** for managing Java dependencies.
- **Node.js** (optional, if you wish to use a local server for the frontend).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


### 2. Run the Frontend

- Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser or set up a local server to serve the HTML file.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies by including the Bootstrap CDN in the `<head>` section of your HTML.

### 3. Set Up the Spring Boot Application

- Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory.

    ```bash
    cd ai_model
    ```

- Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

- The Spring Boot application will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
### 4. Test the Application

- Open your web browser and go to the frontend URL where `index.html` is being served.
- Fill in the form with your skills, interests, and educational background.
- Click the "Generate Path" button to see your personalized learning path generated by the AI.

### Note

- Ensure the Spring Boot application is running before submitting the form from the frontend.
- If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure all components are running properly.
